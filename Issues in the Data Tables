Web Order Table:
-Normally, column J has no data. However, the row 203 has a value in the columnn J and that's causing an issue while uploading the csv file 
to the snowflake as the header was empy.
-Also, there are some rows missing the campaign id information, not an ideal data structure.

Campaign Table:
1. There are duplication in the table. For example, campaign id 120211151098440066
2. The naming structure can be improved by updating the channel 4- and channel 5 naming structure.
--Channel 4: 
  Old:fb-prospecting --> Suggestiong: prospecting.  - As fb is already labeled in the channel 3 column and no need to add it here again.
--Channel 5:
  Old: fb-prospecting-landing --> landing. - As fb and prospecting are already labeled in the channel 3 and channel 4. 

With above sugggestions, we would be able to compare the performance of each channel (fb, search, organic) for the landing, generic, channel 5.
Enabling us to assess the effectives of the campaign and better readability.

Leads Funnel:
1. Suggestion 1: The CampaignID column should be validated with the campaignIDs listed in the campaign table for the consistency and accuracy. For example,
there are two campaignsids entered in the leads funnel table (11348193304807181773, 120207888497020698) however they are not registed in the campaign tables. 
Because of this,the campaign can not be identified and mapped. Maybe, this is a typo while entering the data but not the best practise.

2. Suggestion 2: There is a row missing campaign id however, the campaign_name, channel_3, channel_4, channel_5 has value for this row. We can do cross-checking
and re-mapping the campaignid from the campaigns.
